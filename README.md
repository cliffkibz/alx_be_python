# ALX BE Python Projects

This repository contains beginner-level Python scripts developed as part of the **ALX Backend Python** curriculum. The goal of these tasks is to build a solid foundation in Python programming by focusing on:

- Variable assignments
- Arithmetic operations
- User input/output
- Control flow (if/else, match-case, loops)

## üìÅ Project Structure

### `python_introduction/`
These tasks focus on basic Python syntax and operations.

| File                     | Description                                                        |
|--------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `basic_operations.py`    | Performs addition, subtraction, and multiplication with two numbers. |
| `simple_interest.py`     | Calculates simple interest based on principal, rate, and time.      |
| `rectangle_area.py`      | Calculates the area of a rectangle using length √ó width.            |
| `hours_to_seconds.py`    | Converts a number of hours into seconds.                           |
| `future_age_calculator.py` | Asks for current age and calculates age in the year 2050.        |
| `finance_calculator.py`  | Calculates monthly savings and projects annual savings with interest. |

### `control-flow/`
These tasks introduce decision-making and loop-based logic in Python.

| File                        | Description                                                      |
|-----------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `weather_advice.py`         | Gives clothing advice based on weather input using `if-elif-else`. |
| `multiplication_table.py`   | Generates a multiplication table for a user-provided number.     |
| `match_case_calculator.py`  | Performs arithmetic using Python `match-case` control structure. |
| `pattern_drawing.py`        | Draws a square pattern of asterisks using nested loops.          |
| `daily_reminder.py`         | Custom reminder generator based on task priority and urgency.    |

## üí° How to Run

Make sure you're using **Python 3.10+** (for `match-case` support).

```bash
python3 filename.py
